Java II Project 3


This file describes the workflow process for the group.
For project 3 Errol will be working as the lead and this will rotate on subsuquent projects.
  Errol will be responsible for creating a class diagram, creating the github repo, and managing the forementioned repo to reflect          the agreed upon final project submission.
  Tyler will be responsible for writing the stub methods for the non-functional GUI to reflect the class diagram.
  Mario will write the test case for this assignment and verify the requirements set by the instructor have all been met by having all applicable components  on the panels for the GUI.
  Once the architecture is set up and the design is in place, each member will design two panels. One for the admin section, and one for the search engine. This will be done utilizing the stub methods Tyler has created. Upon completion of each panel, we will meet to decide which panels will work best for the assignment and push them to the master for project submission.
